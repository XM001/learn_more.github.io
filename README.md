<center><h1>Welcome to my Sample Page</h1></center>



<p>On this page I will display projects I am completing in my COP2822 class. All projects are examples of my work and none of the products are available for purchase. It is hoped that learners will see the value in this demonstration and perhaps hone skills enough to become eLancers.<br>
<br>
I will use FTP - FileZilla to publish to my <a href="http://students.fscj.edu/">school's </a>hosting server and AwardSpace to publish using the File Manager feature to publish to my FREE site.<p> <a href="https://www.awardspace.com/">AwardSpace</a> provides both free hosting and domain services.  AwardSpace recently made changes to their free service, please read carefully. </p>
